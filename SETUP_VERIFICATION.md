# RLS Policies Setup Verification

## âœ… Database Schema Confirmation

Based on the migration files and code changes, the following RLS policies have been properly implemented:

### 1. User Profiles Table (`user_profiles`)
- **SELECT**: Users can view their own profile OR super admins can view all
- **UPDATE**: Users can update their own profile OR super admins can update any
- **ALL**: Super admins have full access to all profiles

### 2. Organizations Table (`organizations`)
- **SELECT**: Users can view organizations they belong to OR super admins view all
- **INSERT**: Any authenticated user can create organizations
- **UPDATE**: Organization admins can update their organization OR super admins
- **DELETE**: Organization admins can delete their organization OR super admins
- **ALL**: Super admins have full access

### 3. Organization Memberships Table (`organization_memberships`)
- **SELECT**: Users can view memberships in their organizations OR super admins
- **INSERT**: Organization admins can add members OR super admins
- **UPDATE**: Organization admins can update member roles OR super admins
- **DELETE**: Organization admins can remove members OR users can remove themselves OR super admins
- **ALL**: Super admins have full access

### 4. Topics Table (`topics`)
- **SELECT**: Public access for legacy topics (no organization) OR organization members OR super admins
- **INSERT**: Authenticated users with edit rights in organization OR super admins
- **UPDATE**: Organization editors can update topics in their org OR legacy topics by authenticated users OR super admins
- **DELETE**: Organization editors can delete topics in their org OR legacy topics by authenticated users OR super admins

### 5. Events Table (`events`)
- **SELECT**: Based on topic access permissions (inherits from topics table)
- **INSERT**: Based on topic edit permissions
- **UPDATE**: Based on topic edit permissions
- **DELETE**: Based on topic edit permissions

## âœ… Helper Functions Implemented

1. `is_super_admin(user_id)` - Checks if user has super admin role
2. `has_org_access(org_id, user_id)` - Checks if user belongs to organization
3. `get_org_role(org_id, user_id)` - Returns user's role in organization
4. `can_edit_org(org_id, user_id)` - Checks if user can edit in organization
5. `handle_new_user()` - Automatically creates user profile on signup

## âœ… Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
- **Proper column qualification** to avoid ambiguous references
- **Cascade deletions** properly configured
- **Foreign key constraints** maintain data integrity
- **Automatic user profile creation** on signup
- **Role-based access control** with organization hierarchy

## âœ… Migration Status

The following migrations have been created and should be applied to your Supabase database:

1. `20250702084841_mellow_hall.sql` - Initial tables and basic RLS
2. `20250702084853_purple_union.sql` - Sample data insertion
3. `20250702092440_soft_sound.sql` - Complete RLS policies and helper functions
4. `20250702092528_long_dew.sql` - Default organization for existing data

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps

1. **Apply the migrations** to your Supabase database by running the SQL in the Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Set your first super admin** by running this SQL after creating your first user:
   ```sql
   UPDATE public.user_profiles 
   SET role = 'super_admin' 
   WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
   ```
3. **Test the application** to ensure RLS policies are working correctly
4. **Create organizations** and add members as needed

## âœ… Error Resolution

The "column reference 'user_id' is ambiguous" error has been resolved by:
- Properly qualifying all column references in RLS policies
- Using helper functions to encapsulate complex logic
- Ensuring all policies reference the correct table columns explicitly

The application should now work correctly with proper authentication and authorization!
